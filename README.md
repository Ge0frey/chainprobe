## üîê Security Considerations

- API keys should be kept secure and never committed to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Consider using a .env.local file for development (it's git-ignored by default)
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Monitor API rate limits and usage
- Be aware that blockchain data is public but your investigations are private
- Use secure connections (HTTPS) when deploying the application
- Consider IP restriction for API keys when supported by providers

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues
- Verify your API keys are correctly set in the .env file
- Check API provider status pages for service disruptions
- Ensure you're not exceeding rate limits
- Try using a VPN if geographical restrictions apply

### Performance Issues
- Large transaction sets can impact visualization performance
- Try limiting the time range or transaction count
- Increase browser memory limits for large datasets
- Consider using the batch processing feature for very large analyses
- Use Chrome or Firefox for optimal performance

### Data Discrepancies
- Different data providers may have slight variations in transaction data
- Confirmation status can affect transaction visibility
- Some complex transactions may not be fully decoded
- Token amounts may display differently based on decimals configuration
